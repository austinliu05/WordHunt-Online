# Trie Implementation (Deprecated)

This document describes the initial approach to using trie data structures for game data storage, which has since been replaced due to performance considerations.

## Overview

The original plan was to implement **trie-based dictionaries** for each game board, allowing efficient prefix-based searching and quick data retrieval. The trie structure was intended to optimize game performance by storing game-specific data in a way that facilitated rapid lookups, especially useful for certain game mechanics.

## Why Trie?

A **trie** (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure that stores strings in a way that enables fast prefix queries. It seemed ideal for storing and accessing words or sequences in games, as it minimizes time complexity when searching through large sets of words or phrases. Each node in the trie represented a character, with branches for each possible following character, making it easy to traverse and retrieve information based on prefixes.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Trie Dictionaries**: Each game board had its own trie dictionary, built dynamically during game initialization. 
- **Search Optimization**: The trie allowed efficient word validation by only traversing relevant branches, significantly reducing search time over a linear approach.
- **Dynamic Insertion**: Words or sequences could be dynamically inserted into the trie during gameplay as needed.

### Deprecation

While the trie implementation provided theoretical benefits in search optimization, testing revealed significant **computational overhead** and **latency issues** that impacted game performance. Creating a unique trie dictionary for each game board was computationally intensive, leading to increased load times and reduced responsiveness.

## Transition to Firebase

To address these issues, a new approach was implemented using **Firebase**. By pre-loading game data into Firebase and accessing it directly, the app avoids the need for real-time trie construction, reducing latency and improving overall performance. This approach allows for:

- **Centralized Data Access**: All game data is now stored in Firebase, enabling easy access without the need for complex data structures.
- **Improved Performance**: Firebase provides faster data retrieval and lower latency compared to the dynamic trie implementation.
- **Scalability**: Firebase's cloud infrastructure allows for seamless scalability as game data grows.

## Conclusion

The trie-based approach, while effective in theory, proved impractical in this context due to performance limitations. The transition to Firebase has provided a more efficient and scalable solution, allowing the game to load and run more smoothly. All deprecated files for the trie implementation remain in the repository for reference.
